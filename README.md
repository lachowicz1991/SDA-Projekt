# SDA Projekt
Welcome!
 This project is the work of four programmers:
 Matt Lachowicz, Tomasz Gorzula, Emil Zarzecki, Jakub Kornacki.
 
 - To run the project you will need to run migrations
 and create superuser, superuser needs to be added to 
customer model after migrations are done.

  - In admin panel please create 4 groups which are currently 
required by the program:
'admin', 'staff', 'premium', 'customer'.

- Install fixtures: cart.fixtures.json, chat.fixtures.json
premium.fixtures.json, viewer.fixtures.json.

- This is our first project of such a scale and it is 
still under ongoing development..

Many thanks for trying and testing our app.
